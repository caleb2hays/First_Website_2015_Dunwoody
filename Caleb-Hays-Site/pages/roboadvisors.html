        A robo-advisor is an online wealth management service that provides automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice without the use human financial planners. Robo-advisors (or robo-advisers) use the same software as traditional advisors, but usually
        only offer portfolio management and do not get involved in more personal aspects of wealth management, such as taxes and retirement or estate planning.

            <img src="../images/betterment-review.png" height="150" width="680" alt="www.betterment.com" title="Betterment Review"> There’s no researching which investments you need to purchase, and at what percentage for each. Betterment does this all
            for you automatically. This makes investing easy for beginners and is different than any other discount stock broker we’ve reviewed. Betterment’s goal is to maximize return but minimize the risk. This sounds like an oxymoron, but it’s not.
            The question I’m sure you are asking is; how do they do this? They do it via the Modern Portfolio Theory or MPT for short. By investing in a diverse pool of assets, it should collectively lower the risk and yet stabilize returns over the long-term.

            <br>
            <br> Traditionally this type of service was only available to a full-service financial adviser. So this makes Betterment somewhat unique since it’s all done via automated methods.

            <br>
            <br> Betterment was created to make investing as easy as opening a bank account. Though, let me be clear, Betterment is NOT FDIC insured. Your returns are not guaranteed and are subject to market risk. It’s possible your investment could lose
            principal. Though compared to other investment options that don’t have principal risk, they do have other types of risk. Betterment is an SEC registered broker-dealer and member FINRA/SIPC.

            <br>
            <br> With the service, you don’t own individual stocks or bonds, instead investments are held in the form of an exchange-traded funds (otherwise known as ETFs). The ETFs own a portion of the equities market via indexing. The asset allocation between
            these various ETFs then ensures your account is not weighted too heavily into one particular area, company, country or sector. While this doesn’t lead to outrageous returns, it prevents putting all your eggs in one basket.

            <img src="../images/wealthfront-review.png" height="150" width="680" alt="www.wealthfront.com" title="Wealthfront Review"> Wealthfront is a robo-advisor with an emphasis on taxable accounts but also works well with IRAs. Wealthfront uses Modern
            Portfolio Theory (MPT) to create an automated asset allocation.
            <br>
            <br> Wealthfront doesn’t hold your portfolio, they use the Apex Clearing Corporation. Wealthfront is no different than having your account with a discount broker like TradeKing, who also uses Apex.
            <br>
            <br> Wealthfront invests in exchange-traded funds (ETF) index funds. They offer diversified investment management with continual rebalancing in an extremely tax efficient manner.
            <br>
            <br> It’s like having a financial advisor that’s software based. They manage both personal accounts and retirement accounts, including 401(k) rollovers and various forms of individual retirement accounts.
            <br>
            <br> Wealthfront seems to be catching on with investors. Launched in December of 2011, they recently announced they have over $2.6 billion under management.

            <br> Are you sick and tired of hearing about free financial advice that turns out to not really be free? Well a new startup named WiseBanyan could be the solution you’re looking for. WiseBanyan claims to be the world’s first free financial advisor
            and offers a new approach to investing. But is it really free? We dive into the specifics of this new investment service.
            <br>
            <br> The idea for WiseBanyan was born after seeing too many companies out there trying to “appify” investing.
            <br>
            <br> They witnessed the often misaligned values of financial advisors and their clients, combined with too high minimum investment amounts and unreasonable fees firsthand. So founders Herbert Moore and Vicki Zhou wanted to create something better.
