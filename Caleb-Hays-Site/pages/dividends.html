                DEFINITION OF 'PASSIVE INCOME'
            </h1>


      <p style="text-align: center;">
        Earnings an individual derives from a renâ€‹tal property, limited partnership or other enterprise in which he or she is not materially involved. As with non-passive income, passive income is usually taxable; however it is often treated differently by the
        Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Portfolio income is considered passive income by some analysts, in which case dividends and interest would be considered passive.
